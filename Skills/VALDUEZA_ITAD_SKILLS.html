<!--Hobbies-->
<h3 class = "title" id = "hobby"> HOBBIES </h3>
<blockquote><p class = "paragraph"> Hobbies are a great way to relax and unwind.<sup>1</sup> These are done after a stressful day at school, college, or office.<sup>2</sup> There is no rule of what can be termed as a hobby.<sup>3</sup> It could be anything, from stamp collection to painting, or even travelling.<sup>4</sup> Anything can be considered as a hobby if it relaxes your mind.<sup>5</sup> Hobbies determine what we would become when we grow up.<sup>6</sup> Someone who loves singing might decide to become a singer in the future.<sup>7</sup> It is not mandatory to choose a hobby that we want to take on as a career option.<sup>8</sup> Sometimes, hobbies are meant for fun and relaxation.<sup>9</sup> There are plenty of ways to pursue a hobby.<sup>10</sup> 

One of my hobbies are playing video games.<sup>11</sup> I am passionate about gaming.<sup>12</sup> Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and hiking.<sup>13</sup> Playing games is what resonates well with me.<sup>14</sup> There are many reasons why I love playing video games.<sup>15</sup> The first reason is it gives me a level of fulfillment and satisfaction.<sup>16</sup> That is, gaming rejuvenates me after school or while spending my free time. After playing, I feel refreshed after a long day at school, knowing that I have played my favorite games and let off some steam.<sup>17</sup> The second reason is gaming make my mind sharp. It is a known fact that playing video games improve our brain muscles, muscle memory and memorization.<sup>18</sup> They make us think better and improve our decision-making abilities.<sup>19</sup> I find it funny that whenever I make a clever decision, I feel like gaming paid me off with something.<sup>20</sup>
