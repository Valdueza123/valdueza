<p class = "paragraph"> Movies, provide both enjoyment and stress reduction. Many people find watching movies both entertaining and a way to reduce stress. Watching movies can make us forget our problems is an alternative to anxiety loss. As previously said, watching movies can have a positive emotional impact. Movies can calm us down and soothe us. We reduce the stress within us by lowering worry, and even watching a movie may turn all negative thoughts into the better, as long as it is enjoyable. </p><br/>

<p class = "paragraph"> I usually watch TV shows such as animes and Movies to feel and to escape from reality, movies and TV shows transport us to a different time, place or situation we may never be able to experience. The emotions we feel when wer're engaged by a movie is what makes us come back for more. I especially like thriller or mystery movies, any movies that can make me wonder and think "How would the protagonist handle this situation" or things like "What would happen and how will he or they get out of this situation and handle this situation". I don't like TV Shows and Movies that are very cliche and predictable, they bored me to death to the point I stop watching them. Once I get a hint what would happen next or how the setting is playing out I would get bored and drop the series or movies.</p> <br/><br/>

<p class = "paragraph"> Now this TV series is one of my favorites because it has all the things that I am looking for, the thriller, suspense, mystery and many more. Like I mentioned from the previous TV Shows and Movies, I have been looking and theorizing for the ending of this show but it was very unpredictable. The ending that this show gave me caught me off guard, it even teased the viewers of the possible endings or the "ending" of the show and so I never would I ever thought of the ending which makes this series one of my favorites.
