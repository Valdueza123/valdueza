<p class = "paragraph"> Movies, provide both enjoyment and stress reduction. Many people find watching movies both entertaining and a way to reduce stress. Watching movies can make us forget our problems is an alternative to anxiety loss. As previously said, watching movies can have a positive emotional impact. Movies can calm us down and soothe us. We reduce the stress within us by lowering worry, and even watching a movie may turn all negative thoughts into the better, as long as it is enjoyable. </p><br/>

<p class = "paragraph"> I usually watch TV shows such as animes and Movies to feel and to escape from reality, movies and TV shows transport us to a different time, place or situation we may never be able to experience. The emotions we feel when wer're engaged by a movie is what makes us come back for more. I especially like thriller or mystery movies, any movies that can make me wonder and think "How would the protagonist handle this situation" or things like "What would happen and how will he or they get out of this situation and handle this situation". I don't like TV Shows and Movies that are very cliche and predictable, they bored me to death to the point I stop watching them. Once I get a hint what would happen next or how the setting is playing out I would get bored and drop the series or movies.</p>

</div>

<p class = "paragraph"> "Real Steel" offers a unique twist on the classic underdog sports story. Instead of human boxers, the film focuses on robot boxers, offering a fresh take on the genre. The robot boxers in "Real Steel" are beautifully designed and rendered, providing an immersive experience that can be enjoyed by both adults and children. Hugh Jackman delivers a great performance as Charlie Kenton, the protagonist of the film, and is supported by a strong cast that includes Dakota Goyo, Evangeline Lilly, and Anthony Mackie. Despite the futuristic setting and high-tech robots, "Real Steel" has a lot of heart. The film explores themes of redemption, family, and the human connection, making it an emotionally engaging story that will keep you invested until the end. </p>
